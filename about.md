title: About
---

I'm a software developer based in Montreal. I was born in France, studied applied mathematics, started my career as a data analyst in New York, taught myself to code, and now am focused full-time on what I love doing: building quality software that solves real business problems.

My passion is programming, but I also use my non-coding skills extensively: communicating with stakeholders, writing documentation, managing projects and teams, interviewing and onboarding new team members, teaching and mentoring.

As an avid learner, I enjoy reading a lot about different programming languages, platforms, and paradigms. Some of my latest areas of interest have been static type systems, compilers, formal methods, and functional programming. I see them as a means to help create more maintainable, more reliable, and overall better quality software.
