I'm a software engineer and engineering manager, with 12+ years of experience working on web applications that solve real business problems and offer a delightful user experience. I've worked in a variety of industries, such as Cybersecurity ([SimSpace](https://www.simspace.com/)), Travel E-Commerce ([Busbud](https://www.busbud.com/)), Healthcare ([Tidepool](https://www.tidepool.org/)), and Online Grocery ([FreshDirect](https://www.freshdirect.com/)).

As a software engineer, I work full-stack both on the backend and frontend parts of a solution. I also have some experience with UX and product work. I focus on creating maintainable software, that can grow as companies grow and teams change. Some ways I've achieved this are: striving for simplicity, implementing team conventions, managing dependencies, fostering a culture of documentation, improving developer onboarding, leveraging static types and other static analysis tools.

As an engineering manager, my focus has been on creating high-performing and empowered teams, as well as building a sustainable flow to deliver quality software. Some ways I've achieved this are: improving communication between frontend, backend, UX, and product, encouraging the habit of taking meeting notes, building a sense of ownership notably through QA, involving engineers in product discovery and decisions.

From a technical perspective, I consider myself a polyglot and have worked in enough programming languages that I feel comfortable learning a new one for a particular task or team. I have a strong inclination for [static types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking) and have good experience with [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). Most recently I've used [Go](https://go.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
