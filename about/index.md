title: About

I'm a freelance web developer based in Montreal. I was born in France, studied applied mathematics, started my career as a data analyst in New York, taught myself to code, and now am focused full-time on what I love doing: building great software.

Some things I look for in the things I work on:

- make a difference in people's lives
- use the latest technologies
- have great design and experience
- leverage data in innovative ways

## Recent projects

**[Tidepool](http://tidepool.org/)**: I worked as a contractor for Tidepool, an open-source and non-profit organization whose mission is to reduce the burden of Type-1 Diabetes. I helped build the core platform which synchronizes diabetes data from many medical devices, and was one of the main developers for Blip, a web-based data visualization tool. (**React**, **D3.js**, **Node.js**)

**[Outfolio](http://outfol.io/)**: Outfolio is a simple app that I built to help me remember the restaurants and bars I love going to in different cities. (**Backbone**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**)

**[Excesiv](https://github.com/nicolashery/excesiv)**: Excesiv is a small application component that I used in a bigger project to generate Excel sheets from templates on the server. (**Python**, **JRuby**, **Apache POI**, **MongoDB**)

**[Resumee](https://github.com/nicolashery/resumee)**: I couldn't find a simple and satisfying solution to maintain a resume, so I created my own. (**Jade**, **CSS**)

## Random stuff I enjoy

**A good chat**: There's nothing like an interesting chat over a fresh beer (maybe a couple), talking shop, programming, business, travel, cats, anything really. If you're in town and want to meet up, be sure to holler!

**Hats**: Don't ask me why but I like hats. I have a running collection and I regularly lose them. People seem to think it's fun to take them from my head, try it on, and forget to give it back at the end of the night.

**Guitar**: Ok, if coding doesn't work out, I'll never be the lead guitarist of a rock band! But I like to play a few chords now and then. I also love live music, and if there's some great guitar playing that's even better!

**Travel**: I was lucky enough when I was a kid to live in a lot of different places: France, US, Singapore. I kind of got the taste for travel afterwards, and I love visiting new countries and meeting the people there.
