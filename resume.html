intro: >
  I'm a software engineer with 12+ years of experience building and shipping web products. My sweet spot is backend systems, but I work comfortably across the stack and have led engineering teams. Recent projects are in Go, TypeScript, and Python, but I'll use whatever tech fits the problem. I work best when I have real ownership, direct conversations with stakeholders, and a team of peers who set a high bar for quality and delivery.
